## March 14, 2019 Update

Still been working on my College Basketball Predictions. We're less than a week away from the start of the 2019 NCAA Tournament, so I'm definitely excited about using my models for that.  This year I'm going to have a couple of different brackets with predictions.  The first will be based on the model I used last year with tweaks that I've made in the last year. The second will be based on the model I've been using for the last several weeks reporting out results via Twitter.  They are very different models.  Something I just recently thought of was trying to code out tournament simulations to determine winners.  Will see if I can get it done in less than 5 days with everything else going on.

I also recently scraped together Major League Baseball stats with the idea of doing daily predictions of baseball games throughout the 2019 season.  It will start out as a very rudimentary model, but like the basketball model, I'd like to add in more advanced statistics as time allows.

Currently doing daily Men's College Basketball (Men's CBB) Predictions via Twitter (@danger009mouse) for Top 25 teams as well as local area (to me) teams like Texas, Texas A&M, and Baylor.  Just didn't make sense for me to do a blog post every day.  The predictions rely on data scraped daily.  Would be nice if I can figure out to create a table with predictions that dynamically changes say at 10 AM everyday.  That's something that I will certainly want to look into for the future.

Right now the CBB model is very simple and is currently not related in anyway to the models I had for last year's tournament.  I am currently looking to incorporate more variables, of course, as time goes on.

## December 30, 2018 Update
I haven't updated this particular repo in a couple of months, but that doesn't mean I haven't been working on projects.  I've spent the majority of the last few months working on NFL Fantasy Football Projections.  In the last month I've also started working on predicting who will win a football game based on various inputs.  You can read more about that and any other thoughts I have on various subjects at my website: https://salcorpenterprise.com

I do have several ideas on different projects I want to work on in the future.  Here are a few of those ideas in no particular order:

1.  Football Play-by-Play analysis - may end up putting this off until next summer
2.  Update WTI and Brent Crude Analysis based on Q4 data and project out through Q1 2019
3.  Update Avocado Price Analysis through end of 2018 - may be dependent on when that data is available
4.  Triangular Distribution Post - I'm taking a Supply Chain Analytics class from MIT on the eDX platform, and they introduced the concept of triangular distribution.  This was not something that was taught in my Data Science Bootcamp and not many people seem to be familiar with it in my circle.
5.  NCAA Basketball - All the football analysis, of course, is basically setting up my predictions for the NCAA Tournament in March...of course!
6.  Google Maps API - Been meaning to figure out how to use this and incorporate it into the basketball predictions
7.  Fitbit Data - I'd read a blog post on using Fitbit's API to access your data and analyze it, and I very much want to do the same with my data

That's a small handful of the projects that are currently on my wish list of things I'd like to accomplish in the next few weeks/months.
